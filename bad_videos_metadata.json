That's according to Time Magazine, which writes on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a top Ukrainian presidential advisor, has apparently warned that, quote, people are stealing like there's no tomorrow. One asked about bribery and corruption amidst Ukraine's pressure to root out corruption while it struggles to rally financial support from Western allies following its failed counter-offensive two years into the war. According to the article, the profile details alleged scandals in Zelensky's circle and says that the president has given strict orders for his staff to, quote, avoid the slightest perception of self-enrichment. Don't buy anything. Don't take vacations. Just sit at your desk, be quiet and work, according to one staffer. Another close aide said Zelensky, quote, deludes himself. We're out of options. We're not winning, but try telling him that. I think that quote really points out, Ravi, that you have kind of a delusional leader that was told, you know, you have the support of the West. You're going to win this war. We won't let Russia win. And he still believes that. And he's really leading his population in Ukraine in a war that potentially is unwinnable. They've got a shortage of munitions, but a greater shortage of soldiers. And Russia still controls the Russian-speaking population in southern Ukraine. Yeah. I mean, what is what is being fought for here? Zelensky makes it sound like it's an existential battle for the country entirely to remain independent, you know, to stop Russia conquering Europe. I mean, if that's what was going on, maybe then our European allies could could could be bothered, could be roused to contribute to the defense of this nation. Of course, they couldn't. Frankly, it's not. It would be a different story if this were the case. But it's not. I mean, it's not going to take over the whole country. It has concerns about regions on its border where there are a lot of Russian-speaking people and there is a lot of loyalty toward Russia. Really, the question is, ought these people to have some self-determination, either to be part of Russia or to be an independent state on the Russian border? I don't understand what is what is liberal or Western or Democratic about saying, no, this border could not possibly change directions at all. That could never happen. Of course, we've redrawn. We've the U.S. has participated in the redrawing of Europe. How many times? Like this? This is just something that happens. So it doesn't seem worth the thousands and thousands of lives lost, the substantial distraction from a U.S. standpoint, sending all these these resources here for what? To overcome the Russian army? To defeat to overthrow Vladimir Putin? That's not going to happen. A fantasy, a fantasy of Joe Biden's, because he's repeatedly said Ukraine's going to get whatever it wants for as long as it wants in order to defeat Vladimir Putin. The neocon camp is firmly in in the camp of, you know, we're still in the Cold War. Pretty much. We need Ukraine there. We need to keep up this this iron wall that keeps Russia back from taking over Europe. I think they're really stuck in that way of thinking. But the neoliberals are stuck as well. They're stuck in this thinking of there's good guys and there's bad guys in the Ukrainians. They are good guys and the Russians are bad guys. And there is no winning here. It's only keeping Russia out and ending their imperial project rather than, you know, serving the population, holding an election. I know that's an extremely difficult thing to do in a conflict zone, but let's try and figure out some way what the people in southeast Ukraine want. What is a way forward that makes both sides happy to end the fighting? American people think these dollars could be better spent at home and that they're not being spent particularly well. In fact, they're being involved in bribery schemes and to the extent they're weapons, they get left behind. Who's picking them up? Are we just are we arming Russians? Are we arming some some third group? You know, how many times have we swooped in there, left all our toys behind only to find out that they've been sold to terrorists and not picked up by terrorists? How does this help U.S. security? Why won't our leaders think about what's best for U.S. national security? It's only their it's only their main job. It's only their most important job.
